        "- Iterators and iterables are fundamental concepts in Python for working with collections of data. Here's a breakdown of their differences:\n",

        " Iterable\n",
        "\n",
        " Definition: An iterable is any object that can be looped over using a for loop.  \n",
        " Examples:  \n",
        "Lists ([1, 2, 3])  \n",
        "Tuples ((1, 2, 3))  \n",
        "Strings (\"hello\")  \n",
        "Dictionaries ({'a': 1, 'b': 2})  \n",
        "Sets ({1, 2, 3})  \n",
        "Key Characteristics:  \n",
        "They provide a way to access their elements one by one.\n",
        "They can be used with the for loop directly.  \n",
        "To get an iterator from an iterable, use the iter() function.  \n",
        "\n",
        " Iterator\n",
        "\n",
        " Definition: An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods:  \n",
        "__iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.   \n",
        "__next__(): Returns the next item in the sequence. Raises StopIteration when there are no more items.  \n",
        "Key Characteristics:  \n",
        "They are objects that can be used to iterate over a sequence.  \n",
        "They remember their position during iteration.  \n",
        "You can use the next() function to get the next item from an iterator.   \n",
        "In simpler terms:\n",
        "\n",
        " Iterable: Like a container that holds a collection of items.  \n",
        "Iterator: Like a pointer that moves through the iterable, pointing to one item at a time.  \n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        " my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # my_list is an iterable  \n",
        "\n",
        " my_iterator = iter(my_list)  # Get an iterator from the list\n",
        "\n",
        " print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        " print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
        " print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 3  \n",
        " #print(next(my_iterator))  # This line would raise a StopIteration exception.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Generators in Python are a special type of function that generate a sequence of values on-the-fly, rather than creating the entire sequence in memory at once. This makes them incredibly memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        " How Generators are Defined\n",
        "\n",
        " Using the yield keyword: Instead of using the return statement, generators use the yield keyword.  \n",
        "Returning values iteratively: When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the entire function at once. Instead, it returns a generator object.  \n",
        "Pausing and resuming execution: Each time next() is called on the generator object, the function resumes execution from where it left off, until the next yield statement is encountered.  \n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        " def my_generator():  \n",
        "  \"\"\"A simple generator function.\"\"\"   \n",
        "  for i in range(5):  \n",
        "    yield i\n",
        "\n",
        " #Get a generator object  \n",

        "\n",
        "  - Generators in Python offer several key advantages over regular functions:   \n",
        "\n",
        " i. Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        " Reduced Memory Consumption: Generators produce values one at a time, unlike regular functions that might generate an entire list or sequence in memory at once. This is crucial when dealing with large datasets, as it prevents memory overflow issues.\n",
        " ii. Laziness (On-Demand Generation):\n",
        "\n",
        " Efficient for Large or Infinite Sequences: Generators only compute and produce values as they are requested (by calling next() or iterating over them). This is highly beneficial for:\n",
        "Infinite sequences: Generating Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, etc., without the need to store the entire infinite sequence.\n",
        "Large datasets: Processing massive files or data streams without loading the entire dataset into memory.\n",
        "iii. Conciseness and Readability:\n",
        "\n",
        " Simplified Code: Generators often lead to more concise and readable code, especially for iterative tasks, as they can express complex logic more elegantly.\n",
        "iv. State Preservation:\n",
        "\n",
        " Automatic State Management: Generators automatically maintain their internal state between calls to next(). This eliminates the need for manual state tracking within the function.  \n",
        "v. Flexibility:\n",
        "\n",
        " Versatile Applications: Generators can be used for a wide range of tasks, including:\n",
        "Data streaming: Processing large datasets in chunks.\n",
        "Custom iterators: Creating flexible and efficient iterators for various data structures.\n",
        "Implementing complex algorithms: Breaking down complex algorithms into smaller, more manageable steps.\n",

        " Anonymous: Lambda functions don't have a formal name.\n",
        "Concise: They are ideal for short, simple functions.\n",
        "Single Expression: They can only contain a single expression.\n",
        "Often used with higher-order functions: Lambda functions are frequently used as arguments to other functions that accept functions as input, such as map(), filter(), and sorted().\n",
        "When to Use Lambda Functions:\n",

        " Short, one-line functions: When you need a simple function for a specific, limited purpose.\n",
